    "Your Friend has developed the Product and he wants to establish the product startup and he is searching for a perfect location where getting the investment has a high chance. But due to its financial restriction, he can choose only between three locations -  Bangalore, Mumbai, and NCR. As a friend, you want to help your friend deciding the location. NCR include Gurgaon, Noida and New Delhi. Find the location where the most number of funding is done. That means, find the location where startups has received funding maximum number of times. Plot the bar graph between location and number of funding. Take city name \"Delhi\" as \"New Delhi\". Check the case-sensitiveness of cities also. That means, at some place instead of \"Bangalore\", \"bangalore\" is given. Take city name as \"Bangalore\". For few startups multiple locations are given, one Indian and one Foreign. Consider the startup if any one of the city lies in given locations."
