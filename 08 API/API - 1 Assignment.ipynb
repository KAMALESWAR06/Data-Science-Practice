Order beers and Delhi Masala Pizaa which was partially burnt/with very hard base. Then ordered Dal Makhani with Garlic Naan & I have never had Sweet Dal Makhani. But they were serving like this only. Overall review is not good and felt like wasted money. Go at your own risk...\n",

      "FLAVOURS OF DELHI/NCR 5 Today I have been to this place. Such an amazing interior. Both their indoor and outdoor dining. Just loved their service. We have tried many veg starters, but the Chaap is the best, I had the best chaap till date. Main course was also good. Drinks were super amazing. Must go this place.\n",
      "Delhi Food Nest 5 This place is perfect to spend quality time with friends and family. The place has a cosy ambiance with live music. They also have a rooftop seating area with a lot of greenery, which is perfect for that romantic dine in experience. They are well known for their pocket friendly buffet options, available both in veg and non veg. We tried both options starting with the starters which were barbequed just on our table. Really loved the zaffrani paneer tikka, oyester chilli fish and murgh malai kasoori. Also tried the salsa fried potato which tasted amazing. In drinks, we had regular and kiwi mojito, both were good. For main course, we had biryani, dal makhni, paneer tikka masala, dumpukt chicken, rara gosht with rice and butter naan. The dishes were amazing in taste. But, we couldn't try other main course items as we were almost full and couldn't resist to try their desserts. We had a plate full of desserts. The gulab jamun and icecream was best. Also tried gulabo kheer for the first time and it was really tasty. Overall, we had a great meal at this outlet. Definitely recommend this place!  Recommendations: Paneer tikka, murgh tikka, salsa fried potato, chilli fish, Ra-ra gosht, paneer tikka masala, noodles and all desserts.\n",
      "Mohit Kumar 4 Themis Barbecue House located in NSP. They have inside and outside seating area. Indoor sitting has very dim lighting and outdoor gives a view of metro. Now coming to the taste of the snacks, the taste of all the veg snacks was very good. The main course was quit good too.. I had superb experience.. surely going to visit again with my stag.. Happy Eating..üòãüòã\n",
